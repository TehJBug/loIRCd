This is a very little IRC server that can be used in local network when people can't setup a real IRC daemon

You just have to launch 
	$> ./loIRCd 
to have a running irc server on [yourmachine:6667]
You can then connect to it using your favorite IRC client such as:
- irssi
- xchat
- pidgin
- ...

loIRCd understands:
- /join #chan
- /part #chan
- chatroom
- private chat
